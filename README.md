# Language Data Commons RO-Crate Profile Validator

This project will validate RO-Crate metadata against the [RO-Crate Metadata Profile for Language Data Commons](https://purl.archive.org/language-data-commons/profile)

TODO: How to install as a stand alone tool and how to embed in other tools

# PARADISEC

There are some PARADISEC-specific test that show how to take some test records from PARADISEC created before this profile was developed and firstly make them validate and secondly, demonstrate some optional profile features.

To run the tests.

```
mocha test/validator.paradisec.spec.js
```
