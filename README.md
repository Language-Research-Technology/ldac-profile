# Language Data Commons RO-Crate Profile

This repository is for hosting the [RO-Crate Metadata Profile for Language Data Commons](https://w3id.org/ldac/profile).

This profile can also be updated using the Makefile which generates `profile/profile.md`.

## Updating profile.md with Makefile

`profile/profile.md` is generated by the `make-profile.js` script and its contents. The script use the library [ro-crate-modes](https://github.com/Language-Research-Technology/ro-crate-modes) to generate the markdown file.

If updates are required, edit the following files in this repository:

- `profile-text/profile.md`
- `examples`

Or these files in other repositories:

- `ro-crate-modes/modes/comprehensive-ldac.json`
